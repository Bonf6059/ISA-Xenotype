# Myotragus Xenotype

New xenotypes.

# Ideas for possible next updates

- Add vampiric healing powers and/or power similar to coagulate but that increases immunity gain speed
- Bat or lizard xenotype
- Add textures to "Intimidating" and "Nocturnal" genes and activate them
  
# Old updates

- New Genes:

      - Latent psychic         -1 (it adds a minor boost to psy sensitivity and neural heat or just neural heat)
      - Slow digestion         +1 (it reduces hunger rate and gives immuninty to food poisoning)
